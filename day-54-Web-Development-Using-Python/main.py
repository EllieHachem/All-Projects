#I already now how to make website 

#simple website contain html and css = front end

#we need the backend the functionality more like javascript replacement 

#full stack web development = front end + back end = someone who can deal with both technologies 

#front usaully html/css and java script  
#backend javascript/java/python/rubby + many other langauges so as long as you know html and css you are good to go 

#there is also different framework (more like the place you work with)  for front end  is different than back end

#for front end react  and angular 
#back end node and flask or djungo for backend 

#those frameworks are tools that comes prebuild with the code for the common functionality 
#this way we dont have to always create code from scratch 

#for python backend there is flask/pyramid/djungo(dj)/bottle/cherrypie
#most poplular are flask and djungo

#flask for begginers and small projects 
#djungo  for large Comercial  products 

#what is the backend 
#three compopnents u need to understand when it come to backend 

#client server and database 
#so dont learn javascript just go for python now 
#they determine how your backend will work 

#client  is the user side 
#server is a pc 24 hours avaialble to check requests 
#database contains all information related to your website 

# so if clien wanted to go to google.com that get send to the server(other computer ) as a request and this server 

#if u have a site that have users sign ups more like stuff that requiree excel types or tables then usually you will have data base 


#so like since server dont have much storage so data base there as it can store a lot of data 
#any info of your profile is in data base 

#so like google blogger storage is the database 

#to know how all stuff work think of it as resturant 

#front of it where tables are there and customers sit =client = usually seperated from the rest usually just interacting with browser = client side  

#kitchen where cheif creates everything = seerver = when u request a data the server takes the data from database and renders to html/css/javascript files it more like again API stuff think of sevrer as api  



#ladder where u store all igreedients = database
