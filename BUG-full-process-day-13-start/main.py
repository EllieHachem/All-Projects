#control / to comment and uncomment 
# here is an example just uncomment program teest ur skill to fix problem then comment it after problem is finished 


# Describe Problem 1st tip
# READ THE PROGRAMTO UNDERSTAND IT READ CODE CAREFULLY DESCRIBE IT LIKE
#SHE DID NOW TO FIND SOLUCTION 
# import random

# def my_function():
#     for i in range(1, 20):
#         if i == 19:
#             print("You got it")

      
# my_function()

# range is not like randint as range givves from 0 and this gives
#really the random number
# Reproduce the Bug 2nd tip
#index also start from 0 just randint is an Exception

# from random import randint
# dice_imgs = ["❶", "❷", "❸", "❹", "❺", "❻","7"]
# dice_num = randint(1, 6)
# print(dice_imgs[dice_num])

# Play Computer 3rd tip 
#means just play program and see where the bug occur and then make a line or edit a line to fix the problem  
# year = int(input("What's your year of birth?"))
# if year > 1980 and year < 1994:
#   print("You are a millenial.")
# elif year > 1994:
#   print("You are a Gen Z.")
# elif year == 1994:
#     print("got cha")  

# Fix the Errors
#just see editor red lines and hover over without clicking it to see why that is just obvious error before even seeing stuff in console
#else see last line in console copy paste it  and go stack flow mostly
# some bugs does not even appear on console or here like
#if you forget to add f string to a print statment nothing will be shown here those skills comes with time to improve as a programmer go help other people on stack flow and the more you solve the better you become do that after finishing 2 full course then you become even more a pro daily 
# age = int(input("How old are you?"))
# if age > 18:
#     print(f"You can drive at age {age}.")

#Print is Your Friend
#Print variables used in the equation to see the error and debug it 
# like here always also focus on = or == sign very commen mistake in programming 
# pages = 0
# word_per_page = 0
# pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
# word_per_page = int(input("Number of words per page: "))
# total_words = pages * word_per_page
# print(pages)
# print(word_per_page)
# print(total_words)

#Use a Debugger
#example pyton tutor .com online tool or thonny offline debugger
#break points = code exucation  in a line helpful to fix those red color marks  in a line
# frames and objects look at objects create to see error test it after this lesson solo 
# def mutate(a_list):
#   b_list = []
#   for item in a_list:

#      new_item = item * 2
#      b_list.append(new_item)
#   print(b_list)

# mutate([1,2,3,5,8,13])

#finals tips for debugging based on expreince 

#take a break like if you keep staring on screen unable to find solution your not gonna find solution have a  cup of tea a nap or just go to sleep and do it tommrow 

#ask a friend like a real friend like your real brother a developer preferable it can be in discord or stackflow or someone even taking courses

#asking a friend even at same level is epic since they will have different assumption of the code and they may find it fast 
#you can help them later and they are training too as they fix bugs


# run program with each line or simple function dont run it at end
# now if you did it at end try to tackle one a time it really help


#ask stackflow if your problem is unique or project is really big = unique if you really believe no one had your issue before like if everything fails just ask

#so stackflow is very important 

#as a tip also use w3schools codes they have many easy too to use so both 

# the bigger the bug you make the more professional you are 

#bugs are important part of every progrmmer journy so dont not worry about them
