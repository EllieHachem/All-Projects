#class = blueprint 
# to make class
#pass to negate indentation expected error since most class,functions need intendations 
#use pascal case to name your class (titled)(but you know the words are titled eveen when sticked together tiled usually do for each word seperted by a space) = capital letter for each word while camalcasing is same except first word is not capital letter 
#snake case all letters small letters but sperated by an underscoreee
#in python class are pascalcase while objects are snake case camel case is rare
#attributes = crical chance-speed
#methods does = ways to change attributes or gravity and explosion 
#self = object used by inheritsg
#methods always need to have a self paramter as a paramter  = object used by user = x inside function we use attributs to make it 
# so both need def except attribute we use
