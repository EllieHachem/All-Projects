    <link href="sty le.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> #intenral css 
    #it works as code too as even of it is here yellow if u change it later then it will be as it is change like variables here 
    #here in style type the elemnet you want to change like body then just type what you want to change without strings 
    it is inside the head section and under it okay 
    like now all hr have same style nice saves time 
    #browser usually have defult css 
    #eveything on the webpage is just boxs 
    #use chrone exention called pesticides to the boxes 
    #to reduce errors just make sure to make the ccs element that you want to chang have a lot of properites in it just reconfigure everything so that it will always appear 
    #most import to config is likley color/style/height like everything(every box) have height  except body have defult value that prevent us from changing height 
    also width usually for everything 
    #now sometime you want to open your website on different device so you can not have fixed value by giving percentage 
    #mdn website have defult boarder changes as you type value
    #somtimes we need to make height  0 so that we dont see white spaces espically in boarders 
    #css is really meh just copy paste
    #in border u can specfic which side like border-top-style  for top side

    # learned inline like editing while writing the line 
    #this was internal but if we have many pages we need to use external espically if we have many pages 
    <style> 
        body {
            background-color:yellow;
            border-style:none;
            height:2px;
            
        }
        hr{
            background-color:blue;
        }
        img{
            height=20px;
        }
    </style>
    #css=  cascading style sheets why it was created and why necessary they useed to have only html like font tag or center tag or bg color attribute like h1 and bgcolor 
    problems comes with tables tables are really wweirdy =write alot of codes to make a normal style + very easy to make errors hard also to debug it can not do anything it is
    purpose is to make markup langauges have style usually we start by editing the body and we use style attribute = "something here: argument;" dont forget the semi colon
    go to documantion to find those out go colorhunt.oi to find cool hexa codes they have # called hastag sign or pound sign 

    #now we are gonna learn internal css cuz normal css means alot of editing for each part of html
    #to do it we must go to the head and just below the title add style tag and lose between 
  </head>
  <body> #like here 
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
