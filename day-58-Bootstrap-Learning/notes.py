#  bootstrap for frontend 
# punch of code to be reusable 
# and makes designing website way
# user and was designed by twitter 
# it was not free not it is free
# have 122k+ stars 

# 2nd most started in all github

# shows u how popular 

# it is the most popular frontnent library 

# what it allow u to do 

# msot websites neeed to be resposive
# since most are using phone theesee days
 
# responsive does not mean fast 
# it means it response to the view port
# means the size of webpage will 
# all have the layloyt ddepend on
# the screen = adaptable layoyt


# #u get access to pre-style element 
# with copy paste 


# #in past to create a button css
# we had to go to css button generator 
# then we copy paste 

# #what if u wanted slider/
# or anything else u want another
# generator and what if there is not 

# # use coddeply if  replit does 
# not support bootstrap 

# # we are gonna work with 4

# # the 4 is the minum  to use 

# # just in class type 

# btn btn-primary and vowwla u get the code 


# 0r btn btn-dark to get black button the pimrary = defult 
# which is blue 

# btn-lg = make button biggr 

# so basically we start with x

# and we go x-attribute x attribut 
# like lottery that formula 

# or btn-outlook-dark 


# how bootstrap works 

# download it from getboostrap.com

# we get foldlern amed dist
# more like distination 

# it contain js folder and css folder 


# we gonan go css folder and 
# boostrapcss and we open it with the edditor

# boostrap have defult values

# like browser that overide them 

# it have a lot of class 
# define so u can just edit them
# easily 
# jumbotron = header for website = 
# msot used boostrap class

# also u can just copy past them
# in a boostrap framoork

# lke use class name then it autoamtically

# changes value 


# also if u download bootrap

# if u go doc u can find 
# all layouts 

# in products folder 

# to install bootstrap

# make normal html installtion 

# under title  tag we add the link 


# cdn = content delivery network

# remember how interneti s delivered 
# through all those cables 

# if that is only location in network
# ur site is there = long time to reach
# to other countries and there might be delay

# most sites shold take 2 seconds

# this is wher cdn comes in 

# and boostrap hostedi n maxcdn

# site where max is the company
# of one of those cdn and it 

# have location from many sites 

# usually users have to download all
# of it to cache it but since most 
# users uses this bootsrap
# means most users site will load fast 

# aftr installing even the normal 

# h1 it get the defult of boostrap

# even without editing and u can 
# start editing by changing class name

# other way to add boostrap 

# is just copy and use starter 
# template 


# some components for boostrap to work

# it is gonna need some javascript 
# or jewuery 


# like drop down menua that need 
# more than jsut html and css 

# so ya paste starter tempalte for everything
# to work with boostrap


# thrid way is download 
# and change in link the location

# to boostrap.css but bad idea 

# cuz it wont cache 
# easiest way is to using starter

# template / example code 

# use this with anything new if possible 


# ____

# wireframe =

# presentation of design 

# with pencil and paper 

# more like flow chart before 
# creatign an app

# we do this before doing any html
# or css or java or anything 

# like to build a house we can not 
# build it straight away 

# see if other peopl will like it 

# lik a boss if working for someone

# or friend if not working 

# low fediblity = look very simple

# and does not take long  to make 

# mockup = high fedeality 
# complex and high preseantion 

# like gone to future and take screnshot 

# how it will work

# great thing about mock-up 

# = whatu  see = what u are getting 

# if someone creating ur site 

# sho them mock up 

# problem with it takes time to 

# copy paste

# best way is to look other desinged 
# and websites 

# www.awwards.com/websites/clean 

# then see some ui patterns 

# ui-patterns.com 
# see design patterns 

# see probelms as u designign website 

# u see parts seprated in a website

# and solutions there 

# create simple sketch 

# or mockup after it 

# and at end make 
# prototype = animated version that 

# shows how exactly it will work 

# dribble .com = u see protofilio of othrs 
# to get for job 


# easiest way to create wireframe 

# pencil and paper if online 


# use sneakpeekit.com 

# more advanced 

# use balsamiq.cloud 

# quick and easy and best 
# partu  can share desnged 

# it have 30 days trail 

# or print from sneakpeeeit.com 

# sheets to use ''

# header section is like 
#  seperated section that take space a
# as div/bo 
#e was not working so i instiad usid or nothing 

# implementing = using = applying 

#nagiviation bar = whn u prss on link and go to a spicfic location 
#this is a third party library 
#nav element tag is liki simialr to div but somon rading cod will notice it is realted to the nagivation bar 
#nav like div no dimension 
#nav is like click on something aand it scroll to a sepfic location instead of you know goign to a new page like anchor page 

#boostrap colors are named different so check before using 
#boostrap is like mostly the code written not fully abbrivation of word like some libraries if not most 
#there is even class for brand nav that can be added near normal nav bar to differntiate 
#and make site so cool
#like even margin in boostral is just ml-auto  like margin left auto so easy 
#hamburger menu is wwhen screen is strinked so all navi bar go through to it if u press it 
#make the appear all stacked to each other this 3 lines button = in boostrap it is called nav bar tooggler 
#most fronitid frameworks works really near each others 

#nav bar of brand dont put it in toggler and make suree of location 


#tin dog 

#skeleton projects = like project that does not start from scratch = it 
#maks larning fastr cuz th othr stuff ar asy adn you want to just lar on thign ach lesson
#not redo everything from scratch 
#+ cool if u are just studying not so much hours
# for collpas mod to ork u need javasscript and quiwwry 
#so dont just add link add  also the 3 script with boostrsap below the link of css so that javascript and quiwery work 

#max speed 1.2 for every video + just finish course u are near + learn a skill in the way that might help later 

# in boostrap jsut change col class it is from 1 to 12 and 12 takees all screen and 6 half and you know easy 

#specfify md or larg or small it will be resposive 

# u can add another rule man like next tohe lg add md so usually u need to specficy lg md sm screens so that it become repsonsive 
#so to make cool colum we put all in a div wwith clas row then each in a div
#usse documantion if having hard time 

#so grid  system here is likw row - column system and here u know u can make it easily repsonsive

#now containers in bootstrap basic element blog for alot of elemeents in boostrap like 
#even all the grid system had a div in container  class it is like auto adjust postioning or 
#padding it auto make it repsoive 

#fluide container is another type of container  = takes 100% and repsonsive 
#outline buttons filled as u hover but only have boarders intially with white backrground 

#gliphs = icons  

# fontawesome.com to find icons/glips they have many 

#u can press fowward slash to comment and it autoamtically do for any langauge here so if 
#u change this to .html it will changee comment type wow 
#to use anything in site we need to add script/link or anything in general to be able to use it in our site even ads or verifying site 

#try to minimuze number of things to be aligned together = less worry about aligning  


#add custom class easy jsut add space then class name then edit it so that u add ur own edition to the framework class  
#rotate is cool to make image like image is not straight 
#mdn better than w3school for many people 
#there is functions in css like rotate
#transformate: rotate(45 0r even negatie -45)
#font weight + font size + bold = draw people eyes that is important for website or to see product 
#2nd most important is button is highlighted and outlined 
#3rd is the brand 

#features is like thoe icon that express something like  easy to use with an icon with minimal discriptio
#we add a div and add all bootsrap items in it 
#sfx = sound effects 

#make div inside div to make this very customizable in bootstrap 

# in feasutre icons they should bee in middle so that it appear good  

#heading and subhaeding the haeding is big and font weight and size 

#use vistual hierarchy to make website epic 
#like change color to gray and subhaeding is black 
#visual hierarchy is like whn u make visuals inside image specfic visual more appealing to eyes and they instantly see it before anythign else 

#Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. Designers structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. By laying out elements logically and strategically, designers influence users' perceptions and guide them to desired actions

#fa-4x increasing size of their font ofc everything in documantion usually in most sites or explained in site if no documantion 

#add custom clas always for similar class so that u can differiante and work better 
#icon in feasture should have good margin between text 
#small touches can produce cool effects 
#Carousel  = featuring  all testimonial in slides

#carousle = spelled caroosel = slide show for testominal = people who tested our product in case they used it and liked it 
# though testimonial a formal statement(setnence) testifying to someone's character and qualifications more like proof of achievements /evidence

#each div should have different color to show users that they are in different sections = divs usually
#credits  = how much users lovers u / coverage in media 

#logos usually in footer is less important than testominales search google  for when making website put it near you  = easy making website helpful for editing too 
#applying text same text at same time is a good way to make ur life easier 
#cycling items is like changing items in Carousel should use pause on hover with carousel cool feature that many sites does not put 
#try to make id name or clas same as href if they are related worked in carsoul 
#ariahidden = for impoaried = makee screen reaader skip button = more friendly with people with disablities 
#sr-only also for visual impariment 
#copy elemnt a div to copy everything in it then use it u dont have to reiveent the wheel 

#u  can usually take from bootsnip or boostrap 

#grid system is cool in boostripe for more repsonsive wesbsite as eaech device can have its 
#own resposive way
#block takes whole space 


#advanced css = the z index = each eelemeent have x y and also z index means more toward u or away from you so to go behind it should be behind even advanced people have hard time with it 

#nesting changse the order so it matters to beutify the code #so the first is weakest
#weakest = all other can sit on it = like games order nearly 
#here where z index comes z-index: 1 it start from 1 and -1 is the last the defult is 0 and goes by order but if all have same z index -1 it goes to orginal order so stacking order and z index  effect and used together and z index only work if element have positioning and 2 beats 1 in z index but all must have positin absolute /relative /fixed only thing dont work is static cuz it is the defult = not positon defined 
#all this stacking order so search for stacking order flow chart to make making site way easier 
#sometimes we need to change the  postion of each element to fix the stack problem always check the flow chart 

#like position if u have it then u can use the right 

#grid system is good but cc  metoeiry guricy is better 

# more people using phone that is why designing site import since screen small and there is many phones 
#google effect ur rank on wether it is mobile friendly or not wow so it even scan ur html code what the 
#go mobile friendly site to see how friendly ur site is if not mobile frinddly = peneizlied in search ranking no one search page 2 or 3 and that matter in bussiness 
#either make sepearate mobile site many large websites do it like facebook they have their own site that is epic www.facebook and mobile m.facebook
#third solution make it resposive 
#one was doing nothing xD with just css native functonaity not boostrap using media query 
#what are they ? 

#like using @media print means when printed it change color or @media screen or @media speech called media query spelled Qwery 
#like @media = if and what ? like screen and conditon then do this {}
     
#@media (max-width: 900px)= called media query breakpoint u can combin meedia query like use normaly and 
#viewport = size of screen ur website desplayed at 

#open inspect element and change browser size to see view port screen now and use and to specify a range that is epic 

#transform: rotate(0) = straght up = back to originaal 
#so usuall site is for laptop/desktop tablet and mobile so  varibaltions large medium and small 
#bootstrap grid but u need media query 
#start creating mobile version then go up slowly or go deksktop and go smaller 
#cta = call to action section 

#in href u can use #id name to navi to footer section epic  also works in website
#that is the 2 advantage of id for nagivation through href or links

#refactor code Code refactoring is defined as the process of restructuring computer code without changing or adding to its external behavior and functionality = as a program we should always be dry do not repeat ur self 
#refactor = easy to read and clean = easier to edit code =less line of code = makes debugging easier in the way run saving huge amount of mony 
#ways? 

#order of importance 

#readablity easy to read + a lot of comments  / modularity like making huge stracutre of code like many class and seperate each function so that u can fix it later Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.

#effiency = how fast code run there is many ways  such as changing programing langauge 
#legth = try altinertive small codes at end = but make it readable and repeptive 

#code golf.stack exchange = create codes and u must make them in least amount possible 


#use command between css eleements better than posting same element again 

#refactoring can help in debugging too as u are reading code again 

#write class of each element like try to make refactoring as u write code to make life easier 

# use #id_name .same_class_name to make exception as you refactor code
#so id third use to be used with class to make the all website refractor properly 


#increase eiffiency of code in python
#use while loop moree than for loop
#Use list comprehension
# multiple assignments = assing code same line and use , between them 
#Do not use global variables unless necessary
#avoid using dot so always import method fully
#Use while 1 instead of while True. It will reduce some runtime.
#use libraries from different programs C/C++ Haskell or Clojure
#combine selectors first way using , comma and space 

#hierarchial  selector 
#broad = for everything and specfic for just one 
#2nd way id class  or class name h1/p/  alays go from parents to son  id and class I mean it mustb e parents and child so just up and don 
#last one is combined selector but selector1.selector2 or selector#seelector
#combined selector is bst cuz no space u read from lefto right but space right to left 
#but combined only work if thy were on samee line so here u use hirarcy level 

#so element. class(parenting up to down ) and element.class(this is line inline like even 2 class in same line means also inline )
#repeating pattern = sign of repetion = fix it 

#id get applieed before aything else next class then next html elements 


#selector pirirotry 
#usually last selector will change like normal coding 
#class is more specfic so it comes higher priritory 
#then id is strongest 
#then at end inline css 

#like inline css more important than external or internal css 
#to prevent conflict = using id sparlingy  and use just external css 
#like id for anchor tag or elemnts that id/ and navginational element 

#if going alone just try to use one class
