# print(yesterday_closing_price)
#todo list in pycharm get indented be careful from this it gives error as all codes after it are intendeed 
#TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
#done up now to do 2 


#TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price
day_before_yesterday_data = data_list[1] #easy 
day_before_yesterday_closing_price = day_before_yesterday_data['4. close']
# print(day_before_yesterday_closing_price) #this is simple we printed both days and comparing the closing prices 
#done lets do the todo 3 
#TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
#python abs function 
difference = abs(float(yesterday_closing_price) - float(day_before_yesterday_closing_price))
# print(difference) #abs just gives value in positive 
#todo 3 completed now 4 
#TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.
diff_percent = (difference / float(yesterday_closing_price)) * 100
# print(diff_percent)
#done no lets do to do 5 
#TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").
if diff_percent > 0.1: #usually 5% or 10% will make u buy not 0.1 but for the sake of testing we used 0.1 
    
    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/

    news_response = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT,news_params)
    articles = news_response.json()["articles"]
    #done number 5 and 6 now 7 ya we did it in 5 but lol
#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation
three_articles = articles[:3]
# print(three_articles)
    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
#ya we take commmon stuff to show like title and description
