#list comprehension concept #unique to the python langauge 
#makes code a lot shorter,easier to read,and coding faster 
# a case when you CREATE A LIST FROM A PERVIOUS LIST 
#so far we were doing this using for loop 
#usually we take list and create empty list then use for loop and add to variable + 1 then append but with list comprehesion we use 1 line of code
#AN EXAMPLE

#new_list = [new_list for item in list]
#to make it more simple 
#here previous list : numbers = [1,2,3]
#new_list = [n+1 for n in numbers] # so ya prevoius list both have just we store them all in variable and same loop and same stuff in 1 sentence but we right calculation bfore the for loop lol 
#more simple terms
#old list
#new_list = [calculation for variable in old list]

#list not just for list u can work with string for example 

#test though directly in console easier rather than using print function then pressing run that really wastes a lot of time 

#Python squences = list,tuple,range,string cuz they have specfic order 
#and when u do list comprehsion it will take that seqence and go through it in order 

#iterable 


#there is also something called Conditional List Comprehension 
#the same but with if and only if this condtion happened we loop through this new list 

#in pycharm we can change values from console though in replit nope
